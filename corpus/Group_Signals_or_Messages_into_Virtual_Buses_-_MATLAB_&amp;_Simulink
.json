    "title": "Group Signals or Messages into Virtual Buses",
    "introduction": "To reduce line complexity and clutter in a block diagram and make incrementally changing an interface easier, use virtual buses. A virtual bus is analogous to a bundle of wires held together by tie wraps. For comparison, a nonvirtual bus is analogous to a structure in C code. You can access the bus as a whole or select specific elements from the bus. When you create a virtual bus, group lines based on their functionality. By organizing signals or messages into logical groupings, you reduce the likelihood of significant refactoring. Not all blocks can accept buses, and some blocks implicitly convert buses to vectors. To learn which blocks support which types of buses, see Bus-Capable Blocks. To identify bus conversions, see Identify Automatic Bus Conversions. How you create virtual buses differs based on the location of the signals or messages that you want to group. To focus on fundamental steps, these examples are simple. However, buses are most useful when you have many signals or messages to group. To create buses at the input or output interface of a component using functions, see Programmatically Create Bus Element Ports. Bus Creator | Bus Selector | In Bus Element | Out Bus Element",

            "content": "Open Live Script\n\nYou can group signals into a virtual bus within a component by using Bus Creator blocks.\n\nOpen the model named VirtualBusCreation, which contains three blocks.\n\nTo create a bus that contains the outputs from multiple blocks, click and drag to select the blocks. For this example, select the Chirp Signal and Sine Wave blocks. In the action bar that appears, click Create Bus.\n\nThe software adds a Bus Creator block and connects the inputs to that block. The output of the Bus Creator block is a virtual bus.\n\nTo make identifying the elements of the bus easier, label the inputs to the Bus Creator block. Double-click the line between the Chirp Signal block and the Bus Creator block. Then, enter Chirp. Double-click the line between the Sine Wave block and the Bus Creator block. Then, enter Sine.\n\nTo create a second bus that contains the first bus and the output of the Step block, click and drag to select the Bus Creator and Step blocks. In the action bar that appears, click Create Bus. Since the Sine and Chirp signals are elements of the input bus, the software creates the same bus regardless of whether your selection includes the Sine Wave and Chirp Signal blocks.\n\nThe software adds another Bus Creator block and connects the inputs to that block. The output of the Bus Creator block is a virtual bus that contains a nested bus.\n\nYou can nest buses to any depth. If one of the inputs to a Bus Creator block is a bus, then its output is a bus hierarchy that contains at least one nested bus.\n\nLabel the inputs to the new Bus Creator block. Double-click the line between the Step block and the Bus Creator block. Then, enter Step. Double-click the line between the Bus Creator blocks. Then, enter NestedBus. Optionally, arrange the blocks to improve the readability of the model.\n\nConnect the output of the second Bus Creator block to a Scope block and label the output TopBus. To visually identify the buses, compile the model by clicking Update Model or Run on the Modeling tab of the Simulink Toolstrip. Compiling the model updates the line styles."

            "content": "Open Live Script\n\nThis example shows how to group the output signals of a subsystem or model into a virtual bus using Out Bus Element blocks.\n\nOpen the model named VirtualBusOutputCreation, which contains three source blocks.\n\nAdd an Out Bus Element block to the model. Then, connect the Chirp Signal block to the Out Bus Element block.\n\nTo make two copies of the block, press Ctrl and drag the Out Bus Element block twice. When copying the block this way, specify whether to create a new port or use the existing port. To create one output bus that contains all the signals, select New Element each time you copy the block.\n\nConnect the Sine Wave and Step blocks to the Out Bus Element blocks.\n\nThe label next to each Out Bus Element block has two parts. The first part of the label describes the port and uses the default name OutBus. The second part of the label describes a bus element and uses the default name signal1.\n\nTo make identifying elements of a port easier, rename the elements. Optionally, create hierarchy by nesting a bus element in other buses. Add a dot after each bus name. For example:\n\nDouble-click signal1. Then, enter NestedBus.Chirp.Double-click signal2. Then, enter NestedBus.Sine.Double-click signal3. Then, enter Step.\n\nTo inspect the bus hierarchy at the port, double-click any of the Out Bus Element blocks. The dialog box displays a top-level bus named OutBus that contains elements named NestedBus and Step. NestedBus is a nested bus that contains elements named Chirp and Sine.\n\nWhile this example connects a signal to each Out Bus Element block, you can connect a bus to an Out Bus Element block.\n\nThe three Out Bus Element blocks create a virtual bus at the output port of the model. To see the virtual bus, reference the model in another model or move the Out Bus Element blocks into a subsystem. The line styles update when you compile the model. To compile the model, in the Simulink Toolstrip, on the Modeling tab, click Update Model or Run."

            "content": "When a model or subsystem file requires a bus at a port, define the port with an In Bus Element or Out Bus Element block.\n\nTo specify the elements of a bus element port at an interface, you can:\n\nAdd elements to the interface with or without adding blocks to the block diagram.Define the bus hierarchy with a Simulink.Bus object.\n\nNoteTo specify a Simulink.Bus object as the data type of a bus at a bus element port, an In Bus Element or Out Bus Element block must represent the bus or an element of the bus.\n\nThis example shows how to define an input bus element port at an interface with one block and no Simulink.Bus object.\n\nSuppose the port expects a bus that contains a nested bus named NestedBus and a signal named Step. The nested bus contains signals named Chirp and Sine. Your model or subsystem uses only the signal named Step currently.\n\nIn a blank model or subsystem, add an In Bus Element block. This block creates an input port.\n\nTo rename the element that the block represents, in the block label, double-click signal1. Then, replace signal1 with Step.\n\nOpen the Property Inspector. Then, select the In Bus Element block. Alternatively, double-click the block to open a dialog box.\n\nIn the Property Inspector or dialog box, select the top-level bus named InBus. Then, click the button arrow, and select Add element without block.\n\nThe new element is nested under the previously selected element. The block diagram is unchanged.\n\nThe new element name is gray and italicized to indicate that an In Bus Element block does not represent the element directly.\n\nDouble-click the new element name. Then, enter NestedBus.\n\nTo add an element to the nested bus, select NestedBus. Then, click the button arrow, and select Add element without block.\n\nTo add another bus element, select NestedBus. Then, click the button arrow, and select Add element without block.\n\nTo rename the bus elements from signal and signal2 to Chirp and Sine, respectively, double-click each new element name and enter the new name.\n\nBy adding elements without adding blocks, you can define the entire bus hierarchy with only one In Bus Element block and without a Simulink.Bus object.\n\nTipWhen you want to add many elements without blocks, using the Simulink.Bus.addElementToPort function can be quicker than using the dialog box. For an example, see Programmatically Create Bus Element Ports.\n\nTo specify the properties of an element, pause on the element name. Then, click the pencil button that appears.\n\nThe nondefault attributes appear next to the element name. To further edit the attributes, click an attribute summary next to an element name.\n\nDefining the properties of elements at an interface is useful when you create a file for reuse. The interface definition determines the input that a referenced subsystem or model supports. The hierarchy and properties of the input bus must match the definition at the corresponding port.\n\nSuppose you add elements without blocks then decide that you want In Bus Element blocks that select them. To add blocks for input elements, click an element name or hold Ctrl as you click multiple element names. Then, click . For example, add blocks for Chirp and Sine.\n\nCorresponding In Bus Element blocks appear in the block diagram.\n\nIn the block label, each dot indicates a new level of hierarchy.\n\nFor output bus element ports, the way to add blocks for elements differs slightly. To add blocks for output bus element ports, select an element that an existing Out Bus Element block does not represent. Then, add an Out Bus Element block by clicking . To prevent a conflict where multiple Out Bus Element blocks represent the same element, you can add only one Out Bus Element block at a time.\n\nFor more examples and information, see In Bus Element and Out Bus Element."
