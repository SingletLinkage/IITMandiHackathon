For example, select the general-purpose solver ode4 (Runge-Kutta).Under Solver details, in the Fixed-step size (fundamental sample time) box, enter the sample time for the real-time application. For example, enter 0.00025 seconds (250 microseconds). After creating the real-time application, you can change this value. If you find that a value overloads the CPU on the target computer, try a larger Fixed-step size value, such as 0.0002 seconds. The sample times of the model blocks can be multiples only of Fixed-step size. If you enter 'auto' in Fixed-step size, the fundamental sample time is calculated from the sample times of the model blocks.Click OK.From the Apps tab, select Simulink Real-Time.
