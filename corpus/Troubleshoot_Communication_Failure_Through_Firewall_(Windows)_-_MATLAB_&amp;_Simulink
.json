Even though the connection fails, clicking on the Update button or Reboot button in Simulink Real-Time Explorer works. These operations indicate that the target computer can be reached through the Ethernet port.",

            "content": "In R2020b and later releases, SimulinkÂ® Real-Timeâ¢ uses a protocol for the development-to-target computer connection that is blocked by default in Window Defender Firewall for networks classified as Public. Windows also classifies all Ethernet connections as Public by default.\n\nIf you do not select the correct options when first running MATLABÂ®, it is can be possible to ping, update, and reboot the target computer from MATLAB. But, these incorrect option selections prevent communication connection to the target computer. This communication connection is necessary to load and run real-time applications on the target computer."

Apply this setting when prompted on first connection or apply this setting later through the Windows Defender Firewall Allow an app through Windows Firewall selection. If that is not possible due to privilege restrictions, the issue can also be resolved by changing the classification of the Ethernet interface used for development-to-target computer connection from Public to Private.\n\nNoteIf you develop a compiled application as described in Create Standalone Instrument Panel App by Using Application Compiler, apply these workarounds to let the compiled application communicate with the target computer through the firewall."

If not, use the PowerShell Command Window Method.\n\nRight-click on the Wi-FiÂ® or Ethernet network icon in the lower right corner of the Windows taskbar (next to the clock). Select Open Network & Internet settings. Under the Ethernet section, click Properties. Select the radio button for Private.\n\nPowerShell Command Window Method\n\nRight-click on the Windows Start menu and click the Windows PowerShell (Admin) selection. Run the command Get-NetConnectionProfile. Find the name of the Ethernet interface that you are using for development-to-target computer communication.Enter the command Set-NetConnectionProfile. Use the interface name that you find as the Name argument. Confirm the changes by running Get-NetConnectionProfile.\n\nFor example, if the interface is named Unidentified network, enter the command:\n\nSet-NetConnectionProfile -Name \"Unidentified network\" -NetworkCategory \"Private\""

Administrator credentials may be required to configure the Windows Defender Firewall, or there may be another firewall on the development computer that requires configuration. A systems administrator may need to allow communications on specific ports or add more specific firewall rules."
