Press M to switch from movement mode (the default) to selection mode.The hints panel appears when you enter selection mode.MovementMove a block by dragging it with the pointer.Drag a block with the pointer.The hints panel appears when you enter movement mode.Keyboard MovementUse the arrow keys to move the selected block.When you open Simulink, you are in movement mode by default. To switch from selection mode to movement mode, press M.The hints panel appears when you use the arrow keys to move a selected block.Signal tracingTrace the signal line to the signal source or destination. See Highlight Signal Sources and Destinations for details.Click a signal in your model. Pause on the ellipsis that appears. In the action bar that expands, click either Highlight Signal to Source or Highlight Signal to Destination .The hints panel appears when you enter signal tracing mode.Pan and zoomPan to move the view over the model. Zoom to change how close the model appears.When you open Simulink, you are in pan and zoom mode by default. Press the space bar until the hints panel expands. If the hints panel is minimized, press the space bar until the ? button appears. To hide the hints panel, click the canvas.ResizeChange the size of a block.Pause on a block resize handle.The hints panel appears when you enter resize mode.\n\nTo minimize the hints panel, press ? on your keyboard. When the hints panel is minimized, only the ? button is visible.\n\nTo restore the hints panel, press ? on your keyboard.\n\nMinimizing or restoring a hints panel in one mode does not affect the hints panels of other modes. Expanded hints panels remain expanded and minimized hints panels remain minimized across MATLABÂ® sessions.\n\nFor example, to see the Keyboard Selection hints panel for selection mode:\n\nSelect a block in your model. Press M. The minimized hints panel appears in the lower right of the model window.To restore the hints panel, press ? on your keyboard."
