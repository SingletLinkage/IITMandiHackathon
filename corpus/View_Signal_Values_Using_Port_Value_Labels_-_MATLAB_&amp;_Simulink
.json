    "title": "View Signal Values Using Port Value Labels",
    "introduction": "A port value label displays the value for a signal as a label that floats over the signal line in the block diagram, similar to a tooltip or a data tip. You can add and remove port value labels throughout your model before and during simulation. Use port value labels along with other visualization options to understand, analyze, and debug your model. Port value labels access signal values by probing the data buffers used in the simulation. In some cases, the output port that produces a signal does not correspond directly with a data buffer in the simulation. Adding and removing port value labels in your model does not modify the model in any way, even to make a signal value available for display. When you add a port value label to a signal with a value the software cannot access without modifying the model, the label displays text instead of the signal value to indicate that the signal value is not accessible from that point in the model. For details, see Understand Text Displayed in Port Value Labels. You can configure settings related to port value labels, including the font size and how frequently the value updates during active simulation. Port value labels and port value label settings are not saved as part of the model. For more information about options for viewing data, see Decide How to Visualize Simulation Data.",

Then, on the Signal tab, click Output Value Labels.Right-click a selection of one or more signals. Then, in the context menu, select Show Port Value Label On Selected Signal.\n\nDuring simulation, by default, clicking a signal line adds or removes the port value label for that signal line.\n\nIf the port value label is visible, clicking the signal line removes the port value label.If the port value label is not visible, clicking the signal line adds the port value label.\n\nYou can control this behavior using the Value Label Display Options dialog box. To disable the single-click option for adding and removing port value labels during simulation:\n\nOn the Debug tab, in the Tools section, in the Port Values button group, click the Remove all port value labels button arrow .Select Options.In the Value Label Display Options dialog box, in the Display Values section, clear Enable by default during simulation.\n\nAfter you add port value labels to one or more signal lines, the labels appear on the signal lines. When you add a port value label before simulation or while paused in simulation, the label initially shows no data yet because the block has not executed since you added the port value label.\n\nWhen you start, continue, or advance the simulation by stepping forward, the port value label updates to display the signal value if the action caused the block that produces the signal value to execute. For example, after clicking Step Forward, the port value label from the previous image updates to display the signal value.\n\nIf the port value label displays another message, such as inaccessible, that port and signal in your model might not support port value labels. For more information, see Understand Text Displayed in Port Value Labels.\n\nWhen you remove a port value label, the software does not retain the value that was displayed. If you immediately add the port value label again, the value shows no data yet until the block that produces the signal executes again.\n\nTo remove specific port value labels in your model:\n\nRight-click a selection of one or more signals.In the context menu, clear Show Port Value Label On Selected Signal.\n\nTo remove all port value labels in a model, on the Debug tab, in the Tools section, in the Port Values button group, click Remove all port value labels .\n\nYou cannot add or remove port value labels programmatically.\n\nThese examples show how to use port value labels to analyze and debug a model:\n\nStep Through Simulations Using the Simulink EditorDebug Simulation Using Signal BreakpointsDebug Simulation of Iterator Subsystem"

Often, signal values update during simulation more quickly than you can read them. By default, the Approximate refresh interval for a model is one second. Instead of updating the port value label each time the output method for the source block executes, the software updates the value approximately once per second."
