The issue could be:\n\nThe download to the SpeedgoatÂ® target computer has modified or has removed some required files on the target computer.The download to the target computer put the library in a location that is not accessible when the real-time application runs."

            "content": "To check for this issue, use SSH or FTP to examine the location of the shared object file on the target computer. For more information, see Execute Target Computer RTOS Commands at Target Computer Command Line.\n\nAfter you build the real-time application that links to a shared object, you must install the real-time application and the shared object on the target computer. Put the shared objects in a location on the target computer where they can be found and loaded at run time. The recommended locations are /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib. Root access is required to copy or modify files in these locations."
