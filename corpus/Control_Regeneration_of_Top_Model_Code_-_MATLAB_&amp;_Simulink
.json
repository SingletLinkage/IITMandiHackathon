    "introduction": "When you rebuild a model, by default, the build process performs checks to determine whether changes to the model or relevant settings require regeneration of the top model code. The model build regenerates top model code if any of the following conditions is true: Whether the top model code is regenerated, the build process calls the build process hooks and reruns the makefile. The hooks include the STF_make_rtw_hook functions and the post code generation command. This process recompiles and links the external dependencies. System target file authors can perform actions related to code regeneration in the STF_make_rtw_hook functions that the build process calls. These actions include forcing or reacting to code regeneration. For more information, see Control Code Regeneration Using STF_make_rtw_hook.m. codebuild",

            "content": "If the checks determine that top model code generation is required, the build process fully regenerates and compiles the model code. An example check is whether previously generated code is not current due to a model update.\n\nThe build process omits regeneration of the top model code when the checks indicate both:\n\nThe top model generated code is current for the model. Model settings do not require full regeneration.\n\nThis omission can significantly reduce model build times.\n\nWith an Embedded CoderÂ® license, if you modify a code generation template (CGT) file then rebuild your model, the code generation process does not force a top model build. In this case, see Force Regeneration of Top Model Code."

If you delete the slprj folder, delete the model.slxc file too."
