    "title": "Troubleshoot Signal Data Logging from Nonvirtual Bus, Fixed-Point, and Multidimensional Signals",
    "introduction": "Some models use signals in nonvirtual buses, signals with fixed-point data types, and multidimensional signals that have a number of dimensions greater than two. It would be helpful to view signal data from these signals in the Simulation Data Inspector. The data for these signals is not visible when they are selected in Simulink Real-Time Explorer for streaming to the Simulation Data Inspector.
