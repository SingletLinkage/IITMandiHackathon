Open the Property Inspector and go to the Execution tab.Select the Set execution domain parameter.From the Domain list, select Export function.\n\nTo satisfy export-function model requirements:\n\nOpen the Configuration Parameters dialog box. On the Modeling tab, select Model Settings .In the Solver pane, set solver selection Type to Fixed-step, Solver to auto, and Fixed-step size to auto.In the Code Generation pane, set System target file to ert.tlc. This step requires an Embedded CoderÂ® license."

This example uses Function-Call Subsystem blocks to model two functions.\n\nAdd two Function-Call Subsystem blocks.In the first subsystem, model a unit delay that increments by 0.05 at each time step.In the second subsystem, model the square of an input signal.At the top level of the model, add Inport and Outport blocks."

The function-call Inport blocks also create an entry-point function in the generated code.\n\nConnect Inport blocks to the function() input ports on the Function-Call Subsystem blocks.Specify sample times. Open the Inport block dialog boxes and select the Signal Attributes tab. Select the Output function call parameter. Set Sample time for the delay function to 0.1 (100 ms) and the square function to 0.01 (10 ms).Setting the sample time is only for simulation testing. Sample time values do not affect the generated code. However, comments are added in the code identifying the rate you should call the functions.You could set the sample times to -1 and allow any function-call rate (periodic or aperiodic) during simulation. By setting sample times, the software checks the calling rate with the specified rate and displays an error if there is a mismatch.Rename blocks. The names help to identify signals in the generated code.Update the model (Ctrl+D). Dotted-and-dashed lines identify function-call signals."
