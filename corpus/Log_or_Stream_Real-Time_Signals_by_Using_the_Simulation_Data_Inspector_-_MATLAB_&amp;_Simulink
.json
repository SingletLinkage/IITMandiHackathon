    "title": "Log or Stream Real-Time Signals by Using the Simulation Data Inspector",
    "introduction": "With the Simulation Data Inspector and SimulinkÂ® Real-Timeâ¢, you can send real-time signal data directly to the Simulation Data Inspector or by logging signal data by recording it through a File Log block. If streaming signal data directly, you view the output in real time as the application produces it. The application can produce more data than the SpeedgoatÂ® target computer can transmit in real time to the MATLABÂ® development computer. Data accumulates in the network buffer, and, if the buffer fills up, the RTOS drops data points. Streaming signal data directly does not support decimation or limit data points. To avoid dropped data points caused by network buffer overruns, you can use logging through a File Log block. When logging, you connect signals to File Log blocks in the model. In the real-time application, these blocks store data for the buffered signals on the target computer. At the end of execution, the real-time application transmits the data to the development computer for display in the Simulation Data Inspector. You can then view the most important signals immediately and view the buffered signals afterward. Logging signal data through a File Log block supports decimation or limit data points and supports conditional block execution semantics. Some examples are logging signal data by enabling data logging for a signal inside a for-iterator, function-call, or enabled/triggered subsystem. For more information, see Simulation Data Inspector and Real-Time Signal Logging is Affected by How Application is Run.",

Use this property to set a lower sample time for signals that go into the Simulation Data Inspector while the simulation is running. Configuring this property can help makes the Simulation Data Inspector more responsive and easier to use.Double-click the File Log block. The Decimation value is 1."
