    "introduction": "Control of the real-time application with SimulinkÂ® is limited to connecting a Simulink model to a real-time application through external mode, and then starting the real-time application. Using Simulink external mode is one method to tune parameters. The model connects to the target computer that you have selected in the Simulink Editor on the Real-Time tab. After you build and download a real-time application to the target computer, you can run the real-time application. This procedure uses the Simulink model slrt_ex_osc_rt. To open the model, in the MATLABÂ® Command Window, type: For more information about building applications, see Build and Download Real-Time Application by Using Run on Target. You must already have specified the required target computer environment. Specifically, in the Simulink Editor, from the target computers list on the Real-Time tab, you must select the target computer to which you want to connect. When the real-time application is deployed to the target computer, the step-by-step commands provide additional workflow options. Target | Mux | load",
