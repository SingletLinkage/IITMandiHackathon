    "introduction": "To enter target computer RTOS commands, type the commands by using a keyboard attached to the target computer or by using an SSH utility (such as PuTTY) to send commands to the target computer from a MATLABÂ® development computer. The target computer commands are case-sensitive. For more information, see Target Computer Command-Line Interface. The command examples use the PuTTy SSH utility. You can download and install this utility from www.putty.org. Targets",
