To connect with an available target computer, click the Connect button. The text on the button will switch to 'Disconnect' and the Load button will be enabled.\n\n3. To load the application to the target computer, click the Load button. After the application is loaded on the target computer, the Start button and Stop time edit field will be enabled.\n\n4. To set the stop time of the application, type your preferred stop time in the edit field and hit the Enter key on your keyboard.\n\n5. To start the application, click the Start button.\n\n6. To disrupt the equilibrium of the pendulum on each cart, click the Nudge Cart button. You can adjust the nudge magnitude by using the value selection next to the button, change the reference position by adjusting the value of reference position spinner, or choose a variation pattern for the reference position."

If there is data, the function updates the animation objects.\n\nSignals are placed in an AcquireGroup based on sample rate and decimation such that all signals in an AcquireGroup have the same time vector.\n\nUpdate Axes and Animation by Using Acquire Groups\n\nIn the callback code, this processing is visible as AcquireGroupData signal groups in the updateAnimationCallback function."
