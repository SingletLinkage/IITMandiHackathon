    "introduction": "You can give names to signals and configure the signals to propagate the signal names in a SimulinkÂ® model to track a signal through one block or many blocks. For a list of supported blocks, see Blocks That Support Signal Label Propagation. When you name a signal and enable the display of signal label propagation for output signals of allowed blocks: Simulink does not propagate signal labels for commented out blocks. For example, in the following model, the output signal from the Subsystem block is configured for signal label propagation. The propagated signal label (<const>) is based on the name of the upstream output signal of the Constant block (const).

            "content": "In general, when you enable signal label propagation for an output signal of a block (for example, BlockA), Simulink performs the following processing to find the source signal name to propagate:\n\nChecks the block whose output signal connects to BlockA, and if necessary, continues checking upstream blocks, working backward from the closest block to the farthest block.Stops when it encounters a block that either:Supports signal label propagation and has a signal nameDoes not support signal label propagationObtains the signal name, if any, of the output signal for the block at which Simulink stops.Uses that signal name for the propagated signal label of any output signals of downstream blocks for which you enable signal label propagation.\n\nFor example, in the following model, suppose that you enable signal label propagation for the output signal for the Subsystem block (that is, the signal connected to the Out1 port).\n\nSimulink checks inside the subsystem, checks upstream from the From and GoTo blocks (which support signal label propagation and do not have a name), and then checks further upstream, to the Constant block, which does not support signal label propagation.\n\nSimulink uses the signal name of the Constant block output signal, const. The propagated signal label for the Subsystem block output signal is <const>.\n\nIf the output signal from the Constant block did not have a signal name, then the propagated signal label would be an empty set of angle brackets (<>).\n\nSuppose that in the Subsystem block you enable signal label propagation for the output signal from the In1 block, and you use the Signal Properties dialog box to specify the signal name const-from for the output signal of the From block, as shown below.\n\nThe propagated signal label for the Subsystem block output signal changes to <const-from>, because that is the first named signal that Simulink encounters in its signal label propagation processing.\n\nIn the following model, the signal label propagation for the output signal of the Subsystem block uses the signal name bus1, which is the name of the output bus of the Bus Creator block. The propagated signal label does not include the names of the bus element signals (a and b)."

To display the labels for all signals, in the Simulink Editor, on the Debug tab, select Information Overlays > Propagated Signal Labels.\n\nTo display a propagated signal label for an individual signal:\n\nRight-click the signal for which you want to display a propagated signal label and select Properties.In the Signal Properties dialog box, select Show propagated signals.The Show propagated signals parameter is available only for output signals from blocks that support signal label propagation.\n\nTo configure a signal to display its propagated name programmatically, use the set_param function to specify the value of the ShowPropagatedSignals property for the port handle that corresponds to the block output port that produces the signal. For example, to enable signal label propagation for the output signal on the first output port of Subsystem block Subsystem in the model MyModel:\n\nUse the get_param function to get the port handles for the block.portHandles = get_param(\"MyModel/Subsystem\",\"PortHandles\");Access the handle for the first output port by index.
