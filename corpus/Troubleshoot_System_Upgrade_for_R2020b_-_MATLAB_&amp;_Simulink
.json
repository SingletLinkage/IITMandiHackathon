            "content": "In R2020b, the change to a 64-bit POSIX compliant real-time operating system on the target computer requires a software upgrade for your SpeedgoatÂ® real-time target machine. For this upgrade, the Speedgoat I/O Blockset provides an interactive tool. To retain compatibility with previous versions of MATLAB, you can choose to upgrade the target machine to a dual-boot system where you can select the operating system at startup. Or, you can upgrade the target machine to use only the new operating system. For the upgrade, you need a USB drive and the target machine needs a keyboard and a monitor.\n\nTo upgrade your software:\n\nInstall Simulink Real-Time and other required products.Install the Simulink Real-Time Target Support Package by using the MATLAB Add-Ons menu.âInstall the Speedgoat I/O Blockset. Go to the Speedgoat customer portal.To start the target machine upgrade, in the MATLAB Command Window, type:speedgoat.migrateTarget\n\nFor more information, go to the Speedgoat website."
