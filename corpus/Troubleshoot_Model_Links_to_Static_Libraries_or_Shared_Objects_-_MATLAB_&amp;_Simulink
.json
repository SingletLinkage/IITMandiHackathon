            "content": "When building or running real-time an application that links to static link libraries (.a) or shared object libraries (.so), there are some considerations that help you use libraries that are compatible with the QNXÂ® NeutrinoÂ® RTOS on the SpeedgoatÂ® target computer. These recommendations are helpful when troubleshooting library usage, including:\n\nA link to a library from QNX Neutrino RTOS that is available in the Simulink Real-Time target support packageA shared object that is included in the model through an FMU blockA custom static library or shared object that is linked to the real-time application"

See External Code Integration of Libraries and C/C++ Code with Simulink Real-Time Models. Check that the toolchain can access the library at build time. Remember that the QNX Neutrino cannot process spaces in the path to files."

            "content": "After you build the real-time application that links to a shared object, install both the real-time application and the shared object on the target computer. Copy the shared objects to a location on the target computer where they can be found and loaded at runtime. The recommended locations are /lib, /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib. Root access is required to copy files to these locations."

            "content": "Because linked static libraries are included in the real-time application, when you modify and rebuild a static library, you rebuild any real-time applications that include that library. After rebuilding the static library and the real-time application, reinstall the real-time application on the target computer."
