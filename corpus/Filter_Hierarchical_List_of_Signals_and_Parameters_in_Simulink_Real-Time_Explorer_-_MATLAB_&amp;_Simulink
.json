You can restrict the scope of the filtered display by selecting a level of the application in the Application Tree panel.\n\nSimulink Real-Time Explorer supports filtering by values in these columns:\n\nSignals â Block Path and Signal NameParameters â Block Path and Name\n\nFor example, to restrict the display of signals and parameters to the shift_logic subsystem, select column Signal Name. Type shift_logic into the Filter text box."
