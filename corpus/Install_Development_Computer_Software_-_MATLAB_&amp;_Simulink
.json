    "introduction": "You install the SimulinkÂ® Real-Timeâ¢ software only on the MATLABÂ® development computer. The development computer downloads the real-time application to the target computer at run time. The Simulink Real-Time software is distributed on a DVD or as a file that you download from the Internet. Simulink Real-Time supports development workflows and test engineering workflows: For information about installing target computer software, see Speedgoat Target Computers and Speedgoat Support. slbuild",

            "heading": "License Requirements",
            "content": "Before you install the Simulink Real-Time product, you must have a valid File Installation Key and License file. The File Installation Key identifies the products that you purchased from MathWorksÂ®. The License file activates the installation.\n\nIf you have not received either of these items, go to the License Center at the MathWorks website. For a list of required products, go to Product Requirements & Platform Availability for Simulink Real-Time.\n\nAfter you install Simulink Real-Time, if you are setting up a development installation, you must install the Simulink Real-Time Target Support package. During support package installation, you accept the license terms for the BlackBerryÂ® QNXÂ® NeutrinoÂ® development tools and run-time components as part of the target computer. These tools generate a real-time application that runs on the target computer.\n\nUsing Simulink Real-Time and BlackBerry QNX Neutrino, you can develop Simulink Real-Time applications that you run on a SpeedgoatÂ® target machine (target computer). You can run these real-time applications by using the target computer in connected mode. In connected mode, the development and target computers are connected via Simulink Real-Time software and an Ethernet cable. You also can run these real-time applications by using the target computer in standalone mode. In standalone mode, the development and target computers are not connected via Simulink Real-Time software.\n\nFor more information about the connected mode and the standalone mode, see Real-Time Application and Target Computer Modes."
